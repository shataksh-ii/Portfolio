		<div class="col1"><h5>Beginning</h5><br>It is fair to say. I had many difficulties at the beginning of my assignment. As it is my first time learning html and CSS. I was not familiar with the basics which made it even more difficult for me.  </div>
		<div class="col2"><h5>During</h5><br>After working on this assignment for a few days i became familiar with it. Although there were still many difficulties to overcome it is not as tough as it was in the beginning. At first I couldn’t find my mistakes but after checking few times i would find my mistakes and solve the problem. Which gave me confidence to work on my project.</div>
		<div class="col3"><h5>After</h5><br>I wouldn’t say I have mastered this but I can confidently say I very much know the basics and can create a simple website of my choice.</div>
