	<h2>Experience Learning Basics</h2> <p>It was the very first time I was introduced to HTML and CSS. I would not say it to be very easy. However, over the time I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. After working on it for few days I became familiar with it. I made many simple mistakes and could not find my mistakes at all. Which made the learning process very much frustrating at the beginning. I was very much demotivated and even thought of changing my major. However, after going through the codes line by line for a few times I am finally able to find some minor mistakes by myself after solving the problems by myself it built up my confidence more and more. Which motivated me to go for it.<br> 
	As a beginner everything is difficult doing something for the very first time is always difficult. But since a very young age I wanted to work on or with computers. Computers have always fascinated me. So, I knew what I am doing is something that I have always wanted to do. They say “If you want something bad enough you’ll eventually get it you just have to fight for it. And don’t give up.” Keeping this in my mind helps me through the frustration I face sometimes while I am learning.<br>
	Eventually, taking this course has helped me do what I have always wanted to do helped me learn new things. I have learned many things taking this course and am looking forward learning further.

	<h2>Module Learning Experience</h2>
	<p>Learning this module was fun. The lecture slides provided to us was well explained and exercises provided along with the slides helps us understand and work on what we learned further. Our module teacher is also really friendly and also tries his best to helps us with our doubts. His friendly nature helps us interact with him freely and place our doubts without any hesitation. </p>
	<h2>Developement and Design Decision of Sites</h2>
	<p>This website has five pages that include index, portfolio, blog, contact and site report. All the pages are responsive. I have also made a hamburger menu using JavaScript. I used JavaScript because I failed making a hamburger menu using only CSS and HTML. <br>
The first(index) page. I have used background image (referenced below) and used colors of my choice. I e second (have just introduced myself there. The second(portfolio) page I used placeholder images (referenced below) and made columns using grid to keep images. Also, on third (blog) page I used grid to make columns and described my progress around assignment. On the fourth(contact) page I gave my contact information and made a form. Lastly on-site report page I have wrote about my experience learning basics, my module learning experience and also referenced my work and have placed screenshots of my code validations.
